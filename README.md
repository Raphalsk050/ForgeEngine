# ForgeEngine

This engine was tested with the clang compiler. Please, to avoid errors, use clang.

### Quick Setup

Execute the `setup.sh` script to configure and build the project:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This script uses Clang by default and will create the build directory and compile the engine using CMake.
