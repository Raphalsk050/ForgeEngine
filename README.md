# ForgeEngine

This engine was tested with the clang compiler. Please, to avoid errors, use clang.

### Quick Setup

Execute the `setup.sh` script to install dependencies, configure and
build the project:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The script attempts to install all required packages using `apt` or `dnf`
and then configures the build directory and compiles the engine using

Clang and CMake.
